    <p>
        In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your <br>
        function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return <br>
        the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, <br>
        except for Haskell).<br>
